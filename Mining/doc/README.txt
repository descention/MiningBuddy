,----::)} WELCOME
| 
|  Thank you for downloading MiningBuddy, the premier mining solution for
|  EVE-Online corporations who want to keep their mining business easy 
|  and simple, without having too much extra paperwork on their hands. 
| 
|  Miningbuddy is geared from ground up to be stable and secure - No one,
|  except those who are allowed to to so, can modify or change information
|  like payout rolls or ore amounts. Logging in is more secure that the
|  average internet banking portal, beeing close to paranoid.
|  
|  Over 3,000 downloads and one hundred hosted installations show that
|  MiningBuddy keeps its promise.
|  
|  On a sidenote, MiningBuddy outranks every other EvE Online related tool
|  hosted on sourceforge.net, even the killboards. There is hope:
|  Not everyone on eve is a cold blooded killer ;)

,----::)} INSTALLATION
| 
|  To install and operate MinindBuddy you will need:
| 
|  > *NIX / Linux
|  > php5         5.x     
|  > MySQL        5.x   
|  > php5-gd      5.x
|  > php5-mysqli  5.x
|  > php5-pear    5.x
|  > php5-session 5.x
|  > php5-tidy    5.x (This is optional. You can turn it on or
|                          off in the configuration file.)
|  
|   All these modules are part of any base Linux installation.
|   Consult your Linux manual for installation of missing packages.
| 
|   .-- IMPORTANT -------------------------------------------------------
|   |
|   | > PHP 4 OR OLDER BELOW WILL NOT WORK WITH MININGBUDDY
|   |                        
|   | > Noone really tried installing MiningBuddy on a "Windows Server" 
|   |   to my knowledge by now. It May work. But I am not giving support
|   |   for Windows in any way. If you use Windows and it does
|   |   not work you are on your own. Sorry.
|   | 
|   | > If you run MiningBuddy over an SSL connection (https://) you need
|   |   to configure your PHP to include OpenSSL (php5-openssl) in order
|   |   to generate images and link to itsself.
|   |
|   `--------------------------------------------------------------------
| 
|   MiningBuddy expects all those modules to be correctly installed. It
|   does currently NOT check if they actually are. If you get class not
|   found errors or similar, chances are that you are missing one 
|   important module. If you do and are unable to install the module let
|   me know, I will then bundle the missing module with the next version
|   of miningbuddy.
| 
| 1. Unpack the MiningBuddy in a directory of your choice, and set up your
|    WebServer accordingly. Create a MySQL Username, Password and Database
|    for use with MiningBuddy. I recommend phpmyadmin - great tool to do
|    just that!
| 
| 2. Copy /etc/config-release.php to ./etc/config.{hostname}.php and edit
|    it accordingly. Most things in there are self-explanatory.
|    Replace {hostname} with your hostname, example: The demo installation
|    of MiningBuddy is located at http://demo.miningbuddy.net, so the
|    config file is config.demo.miningbuddy.net.php - easy enough, or?
| 
| 3. Make sure there is a web-server writable ./images/cache/{hostname}
|    directory. It's used to store dynamically generated images.
|   
| 4. Create the databases schemas. Open your webbrowser and point to your 
|	 MiningBuddy installation.  If you installed it in the root of the 
|    subdomain mining.example.org head to http://mining.example.org.  You 
|	 will be prompted to create you database tables.  Once the tables are 
|	 created click continue to start MiningBuddy for the first time.
|   
| 5. Create an admin account. 
|    You should see the Create initial Superadmin account page of your new 
| 	 MiningBuddy installation. You can create this account one of two ways.  
|	 Enter an Eve Online Character Name, this should be exactly as it appears 
|	 in game.  Next enter a valid email address for this account.  You will 
|	 then recieve an email with the account password.  
|   
| 6. Head to your webserver with your browser and try the MiningBuddy.
| 
| MiningBuddy thrives from feedback. I *need* your wishes and problems
| to debug and enhance this program. And of course, if you like it, 
| Donations in form of ISK or Blueprints are gladly accepted :)
`-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I hope you will enjoy MiningBuddy as much as I enjoyed coding it for you.

Fly Safe!
