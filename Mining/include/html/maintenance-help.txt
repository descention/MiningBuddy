<h3>Maintenance help</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Cached images:</b> Items like player name, rank, division icons, site name and logo and system
name buttons are all generated on the fly and then stored in the database and the harddisk. If you run
low on disk space or if you have broken images (non-existant ones) you can wipe the image database,
free your disk space and force the generation of new images. Images are generated automagically. The
next site load might take longer.</li>
<li><b>Authenticated Sessions:</b> Everytime someones successfuly logs in a session is created and stored
in the database. Uppon exit, session time expiration or double-login such a session is marked invalid, but
kept in the database. You can wipe the database clean of such entries to save disk space; there is
no other benefit to it. <b><font color="#ff0000">Warning!</font> Wiping the session database will
log you out!</b></li>
<li><b>Failed login attempts:</b> If someone tries to login with a faulty username and password combination
the IP address, browser, time of attempt and the username is stored in a database, used to temporarily
block usernames or IP addresses. You can choose to clean the records here. </li>
<li><b>Cans in Database:</b> If you have a lot of cargo containers in the database that are not 
deleted or a un-popable you can wipe the cargo container database here.</li>
<li><b>API Keys:</b> You can choose to drop all submited API keys from the database, if you so desire.</li>
</ul>

<b>A rule of thumb:</b> MiningBuddy is self-maintaining and you only should wipe a database of its
contents only when you deem it neccessary to do so.
